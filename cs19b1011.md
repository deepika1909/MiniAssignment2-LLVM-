MINI ASSIGNMENT 2:LARGE CODE BASES AND OOP

c++ 11/c++14 features used<br>
auto:auto uses type deduction which is much easier to use.

override:compiler can check so that you are not altering/adding new methods in the derived class.

static_cast<Type*>(ptr):easy to locate and does implicit conversions between types during compile time.

dyn_cast<Type*>(ptr):similar to dynamic_cast operator in c++ but the only difference is that the class does not require a v-table like dynamic_cast.
The LLVM source-base makes extensive use of a custom form of RTTI. These templates have many similarities to the C++ dynamic_cast<> operator.

unique_ptr:replaced by auto_ptr in c++17,it completely owns the object it manages and does not share the ownership with other classes.

make_unique:creates and returns a unique_ptr to an object of the specified type.

constexpr:used to declare objects and functions,is computed at compile time.can be used with member and non member functions and also constructors unlike const which can only be used for non static member functions,not functions in general.

explicit:helps in preventing the compiler from doing implicit conversion to a constructor if explicit is mentioned in prefix.

enum class:stronger than plain enum,does not implicitly convert their values to other types and hence less prone to cause errors.

abort():indicates an abnormal end to the program.

int64_t :standardised in c++,guarantees 64bits of storage unlike unsigned long long which is not standardised and size can change depending on the system running the code.

Range based for loop:easy to use compared to traditional for loop,simple syntax,no need to calculate size of range expression,auto specifier can be used instead of data type for range declaration,no conditional statements are required.

uintptr_t:better than using a void*,void* always needs to point to something but uintptr_t is an integer value that is safe to convert to/from a pointer.

Class hierarchy<br>
Value.h(llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Value.h) header file contains the subclasses defined(user class,instruction class,function class,Constant class etc) for the value class(superclass).

Type class in Type.h(llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Type.h) has public methods defined in it-<br>
TypeID getTypeID()[returns the type id for the type]<br>
bool isVoidTy()[returns true it is void type]<br>
bool isFloatingPointTy()[returns true if it is one of six floating point types]<br>
bool isTokenTy()[returns true if it is token]<br>
bool isIntegerTy()[returns true if it is an instance of IntegerType] etc.<br>

OOP Design Decisions and Design patterns in LLVM<br>
llvm uses outs(),errs() instead of std::cout and std::cerr.

OOP concepts used are modularity,inheritance,polymorphism etc.

Modularity is achieved mainly by dividing into namespaces and libraries.
Major Design pattern for LLVM is based on dividing various parts into separate libraries.
Namespaces such as llvm,clang etc have also been used to group some declarations and to avoid conflict with standard library names in namespace std. 

Inheritance is observed in many classes,for example-<br>
(these classes are present in llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/IR).<br>
User class is derived from value class.<br>
Instruction class is derived from user class.<br>
Constant class is derived from user class.<br>
GlobalValue class is derived from constant class etc.<br>

Polymorphism can also be observed as there are many classes that are related to each other by inheritance,for example-
As shown above in inheritance,user,constant and globalValue classes are related to each other as they can be derived from one another.

Templates are defined in llvm-project/clang/include/clang/AST/TemplateName.h .

Usage of iterators and their own data structures<br>
SmallVector<Type,N>:similar to vector<type>,it is efficient,it supports iteration, lays out elements in memory order, supports push_back/pop_back operations, supports random access to its elements, etc.The main advantage of SmallVector is that it allocates space for some number of elements (N) in the object itself. 

Iterators used in SmallVector data structure are const_iterator,reverse_iterator,const_reverse_iterator.
